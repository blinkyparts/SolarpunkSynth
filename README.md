# SolarpunkSynth ðŸŒžðŸŽ¹

A solar-powered synthesizer that creates experimental sounds, rhythmic patterns, and beats using minimal energy from the sun! This project embodies the spirit of solarpunk by combining sustainable energy with creative expression.

## Description

The SolarpunkSynth is an ultra-low power consumption synthesizer that can be powered by:
- Silicon solar cells
- DIY DSSC (Dye-sensitized solar cells)
- Alternative power sources (mud batteries, potato power, coconut energy)
- Nearly depleted batteries (due to extremely low power requirements)

## Project Variants

This repository contains two versions of the SolarpunkSynth:

### 1. Original SolarpunkSynth
Located in [`/SolarPunkSynth`](./SolarPunkSynth)
- The original version of the solar-powered synthesizer
- Simple and elegant design
- Perfect for beginners and workshops
- Includes complete documentation and assembly instructions

### 2. Digilog Edition
Located in [`/SolarSynth_digilog`](./SolarSynth_digilog)
- Enhanced version with digital-inspired aesthetics
- Developed for the Digilog exhibition in Taipei, Taiwan
- Features artistic PCB design with custom graphics
- Same core functionality with a unique visual style

## Technical Details

The synthesizer is built around these key features:
- Based on hex-inverter chip (74HC14)
- Three interdependent oscillators coupled through piezo discs
- Ultra-low energy consumption (<0.5mA)
- Audio output via 3.5mm jack
- Organic, variable rhythms through unstable circuit states
- KiCad PCB design files included
