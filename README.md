# SolarpunkSynth ðŸŒžðŸŽ¹

A solar-powered synthesizer that creates experimental sounds, rhythmic patterns, and beats using minimal energy from the sun! This project embodies the spirit of solarpunk by combining sustainable energy with creative expression.

## Description

The SolarpunkSynth is an ultra-low power consumption synthesizer that can be powered by:
- Silicon solar cells
- DIY DSSC (Dye-sensitized solar cells)
- Alternative power sources (mud batteries, potato power, coconut energy)
- Nearly depleted batteries (due to extremely low power requirements)

## Technical Details

The synthesizer is built around these key features:
- Based on hex-inverter chip (74HC14)
- Three interdependent oscillators coupled through piezo discs
- Ultra-low energy consumption (<0.5mA)
- Audio output via 3.5mm jack
- Organic, variable rhythms through unstable circuit states
- KiCad PCB design files included

## Repository Contents

- `/SolarPunkSynth/` - KiCad project files including schematics and PCB design
- `/SolarPunkSynth/002_SolarPunkSynth_footprints.pretty/` - Custom footprints for the PCB
- `/MASK/` - PCB mask files and design assets
- `/SolarPunkSynth/instructions/` - Assembly guides and schematics

## Workshop Information

This project is designed to be beginner-friendly and has been successfully taught in workshops across various locations including:
- Taipei, Taiwan (Digilog)
- Chiang Mai, Thailand
- Tokyo, Japan (FabCafe)

No prior electronics knowledge is required - just enthusiasm for experimental sounds and solar-powered creativity!

## Credits

This circuit is a modified version of the StarvationSynth originally developed by Ralf Schreiber and Uwe SchÃ¼ler. The current version was specifically developed by Marc Dusseiller (dusjagr) to support the exhibition "1,540,000nm DSSC" by Shih Wei-Chieh at FabCafe Tokyo.
